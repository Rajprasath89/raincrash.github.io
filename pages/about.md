Hello.

<p>I'm Sricharan.
<br/>
I make stuff that work on computers. </p>


<p>I'm currently a Mobile and UX consultant at <a href="http://sap.com">SAP</a>. Previously, I was a Software Development Engineer and Research Intern at <a href="http://runnr.in">Runnr</a>, which is now acquired by <a href="https://www.zomato.com">Zomato</a>.</p>

<p>I'm also a Chapter Leader for <a href="http://isocblr.org">Internet Society India Bangalore</a>.</p>

<p>I pass most of my leisure time with my Kindle PW3. I love read eastern manga and western comics. I do watch a lot of anime.</p>

<p>These days, I usually hangout at <a href="http://devup.in">Devup</a>. You can also reach me via e-mail at <img src="/assets/email.png" height="18">.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
