<div class="about">
Hello.

<p>I'm Sricharan Chiruvolu. I make stuff that work on computers.</p>

<p>I consider myself a (wannabe) full-stack software engineer who is fiercely passionate about the user experience and interaction of a product. I'm currently working in the tech stack of Rails, Android and Angular. I’m glad I picked up Python even though it wasn’t being taught in school and I’ve enjoyed using it ever since.</p>

<p>I'm an open-source believer. I was accepted for Google Summer of Code and also mentored a student for Google Code-In.  I occasionally participate in a few technical forums and attend meetups whenever I can. I also write technical articles for Open Source For You magazine and a few other online forums.</p>

<p>Till date, I worked on projects related to Linux OS, computer graphics, bioinformatics and typical software engineering. I would love to teach myself machine learning and deep learning sometime soon.</p>

<p>I usually go by {{ site.github_username }} on the internet.</p>

<p>I pass most of my leisure time with my Kindle PW3. I also read eastern manga and western comics. I do watch a lot of anime.</p>

<p>My e-mail: <pre>sricharan.chiruvolu at gmail dot com</pre></p>
