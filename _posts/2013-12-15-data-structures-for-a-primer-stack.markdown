Stack is used for representing things that need to be maintained in a particular order. A third function needs to return back only to the second function rather than the first, when first calls the second and the second calls the third.

Simply saying, A Stack is a data structure that allows adding and removing elements in a particular order. Note that a stack, with an analogy to a pile of trays, the first item added will be the last item removed from the stack.

The following terminology is associated with Stacks: 

       **PUSH** To add an element to the stack.  
**POP** To remove an element from the stack.  
**PEEK** To look at elements in the stack without removing them.  
**PUSH** To add an element to the stack.  
       **LIFO** Refers to the "Last In, First Out" behavior of the Stock.  
       **PUSH** Same as "LIFO"
