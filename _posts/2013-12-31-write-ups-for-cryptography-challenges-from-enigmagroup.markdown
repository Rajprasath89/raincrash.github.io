**Challenge 1**:

This is ROT13 Ceaser cipher. It can be easily identified as it is a continuous string with capital and smaller alphabets without any numericals.  
  
**Challenge 2:**

This one was base64. It's a little harder than the previous mission. The == operators give base64 away.

  


**Challenge 3:**

This is a MD5 hash.The MD5 message-digest algorithm is a widely used cryptographic hash function producing a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value, typically expressed in text format as a 32 digit hexadecimal number. MD5 has been utilized in a wide variety of cryptographic applications, and is also commonly used to verify data integrity.  
  
**Challenge 4:**

This is SHA-1. SHA-1 produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value. A SHA-1 hash value is typically expressed as a hexadecimal number, 40 digits long.SHA stands for "secure hash algorithm". The four SHA algorithms are structured differently and are distinguished as SHA-0, SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3. SHA-1 is very similar to SHA-0, but corrects an error in the original SHA hash specification that led to significant weaknesses. The SHA-0 algorithm was not adopted by many applications. SHA-2 on the other hand significantly differs from the SHA-1 hash function
