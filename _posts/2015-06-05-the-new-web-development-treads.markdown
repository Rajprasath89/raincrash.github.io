I was introduced HTML in my 7th grade. I still remember the day when I created a 'click me' button in javascript and CSS. It was fascinating. We had a decent computer science lab in school, where we secretly accessed pokemoncrater.com which worked like magic. The world of web development and computer science changed a lot in these eight years. (see: [Moore's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law))


We now have, half a dozen of languages, a handful of database systems, a dozen of javascript frameworks, deployment techniques, paradigms and technologies to ponder before we could start a project. The usual HTML+ CSS + JS + PHP + MySQL style is no longer mainstream. Single page applications, Responsive design, MEAN stack e.t.c. are the new treads of web development. Android/ iOS knowledge, machine learning are added bonuses. By the time you learn all these, a whole new set of technologies will have replaced them.

**So, What does an up-and-coming full-stack developer do?**

_Stacks_ are a lot bigger than they used to be. And being able to claim one has acquired refined skills at every layer of web development is certainly not a big claim. That would mean you have a broad range of skills or you're an expert on nothing.

LAMP was a trend of 2010. It's now obselete. A full-stack developer would program both the client-side logic and the front-end design. The only reason he (or she) could do that is because the _Full-stack_ meant less layers. Either I am too young toÂ criticize or maybe I just don't like the term, but there won't be any full-stack web developers in the near future.

With that being said, I feel, the skill to learn new skills is the only skill in CS.
