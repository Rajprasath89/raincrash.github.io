Hola!

The first week of Google Summer of Code came to an end. This week hadn't been much of coding, but a decent amount of reading docs, understanding codebase and of course, enjoying the welcome gifts (and my first stipend!).

Man, the Genie/ Vala (It's Genie actually, but it's almost similar to Vala in most aspects) is a really cool language. It's crisp, easy to code and understand. But there are very few resources available. The only two major ones are of course, the Genie offical tutorial and the Vala docs (that should be enough, isn't it?).

Well, this was a slow start from my side (really slow!). On my very first day, I made six pushes, that fixed five examples _(namely, void.py, planar.py, multiple\_lights.py, eyecandy\_scripy.py and eyecandy\_script2.py)_. For the last three days, there wasn't any push from me (I have been a sloth!). I am planning to add Spotlights to the light.gs really soon.

Next best part of the week, the welcome pack and the first payment. I don't know if this happens to all but my welcome pack got stuck at customs and I had to submit a couple of authorization and KYC forms to get it back.  And it finally arrived. I got to see the miracle pen/pencil everyone is talking about. _Edit: At first, fellow gsocers were really confused how to use this. Finally someone figured it out. _I bought a new smartphone with my first stipend, my xperia grew old.

Also, I am writing an article on "Introduction to Computer Graphics with OpenGL" for the Open Source for You magazine. Thanks to my friends at #amfoss who suggested me to do so. Hope it gets published.
