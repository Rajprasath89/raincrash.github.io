	  <h3>Hi, I'm Sricharan.</h3>
	  <h3>As of March 2016, I'm a Technology Intern at Runnr, a hyper-local logistics start-up in Bangalore, India. I will be graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in May 2016. </h3>
	  <h3>I consider myself a (wannabe) full-stack software engineer who is fiercely passionate about the user experience and interaction of a product. I'm currently working in the tech stack of Rails, Android and Angular. I’m glad I picked up Python even though it wasn’t being taught in school and I’ve enjoyed using it ever since.</h3>
	  <h3>I'm an open-source believer. Most of my code is available <a href="https://github.com/raincrash">here</a> and <a href="http://openhub.net/accounts/sricharan">here</a>. I was accepted for <a href="https://www.amrita.edu/news/amrita-student-sricharan-chiruvolu-wins-student-developer-google-summer-code-2015">Google SoC program</a> with Copyleft Foundation and mentored a student for Google Code-in. I occasionally partipate in a few technical forums and attend meetups whenever I can.</h3>
	  <h3>Till date, I worked on projects related to Linux OS, computer graphics, bioinformatics and typical software engineering. I would love to teach myself machine learning and deep learning sometime soon.</h3>
	  <h3>I also write technical articles for <a href="http://electronicsforu.com/electronicsforu/subscription/newsubsc2scheme.asp">Open Source For You</a> magazine and a few other online forums. OSFY are available under creative commons licence <a href="http://opensourceforu.efytimes.com/author/sricharan-chiruvolu/">here</a> posted few month after publication.</h3>
	  <h3>I pass most of my leisure time with my Kindle PW3. I also read eastern manga and western comics. I do watch a lot of anime.</h3>
	  <h3>An internet search can give you lot more info: <a href="https://www.google.co.in/search?q=Sricharan+Chiruvolu">Search</a>. I also go by <strong>Raincrash</strong>, <strong>Sricharanized</strong> and <strong>Shinigami_pro</strong> handles.</h3>
